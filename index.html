                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>     Hello, my name is Vincent and I'm the developer of this portfolio. 
                I am an up and coming software developer-in-training working towards web 
                development. I've studied with other languages like C++, Java, and Python 
                and look forward to expand my knowledge with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.</p>
                <p>     I've previously studied and worked with an Chemical Engineer background, working in plant facilities. 
                My curiousity with computer technology and programming came from my field of work as the Engineer
                tasked troubleshooting control board systems and logic. Thus, I decided to take a detour 
                into the unknown field of computer science and explore this frontier.
                </p>
